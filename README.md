# ttgo_esp32_helium


This repo is being used as a catchall for development on the TTGO LoRa esp32 board. The original forked repo from MakerspaceCT dealt with a simple button press
to send packets over the helium network. I have since attempted to add a temp sensor. 

It should be noted that the original file utilizes RTOS. While still written in C++, RTOs differs from the Ardiuno standard and has many nuances that I'm still learning.
